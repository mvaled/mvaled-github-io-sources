            <description><![CDATA[<h1>TDD is dead rally</h1>
<p>These days there’s a kind of a rally about “TDD being dead”.</p>
<p>Most TDD fan supporters are true that you must have a way to proof your code
works.  Many computer <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">scientists</a> have done several attempts into
the “proofs of correctness” for a program.  But tests are not always proofs,
some are <a class="footnote-reference" href="#some-are" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>I think the main argument is about when TDD is too much.  Several <a class="reference external" href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com">Destroy all
software</a> screencasts show a TDD flow that I simply find it’s too
much.  But they are, indeed, screencasts; and they are probably intended to
illustrate a point and not to be followed without deviations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I don’t like the “TDD is dead” mantra either.  It gives space to
a flame war I’m not willing to get into.  I use tests and that’s it.  Tests,
at different, levels may express several concerns I need to keep stable:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p class="first">A public API, for instance, should not change just like that.  At least not
after you have made the commitment to keep it stable.</p>
<p>You may even need to test for deprecation warnings being issued when you
need to change an API.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Collaborative in-progress debugging.  This tests allow to express standing
issues.  Some regression tests fall into this category.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you do tests?</p>

and <cite>O. Patashnik</cite> called “Concrete Mathematics” shows some
proofs that allow “proof-by-instances”.</td></tr>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Progress moving to github.io</h1>
<p>As you may see, I have made some progress.  Basically, I have partially ported
my past look and feel, so that if looks like the old blog.  I still a work in
progress and the “responsive” stuff is not entirely done.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think this is good to go and will start blogging here from now
on.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Welcome]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>This post intends to be one to welcome my previous readers from <a class="reference external" href="http://manuelonsoftware.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>.  I
still have much to do to make this blog actually <strong>my</strong> blog:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Polish a theme that resembles my current Wordpress look and feel.  I like
that central column, big fonts in big screens, unobtrusive reading and so
on.</li>
<li>Port my last posts to this new blog.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the moment, though, this post is enough to avoid the default “Not found”
message.  For the moment, also, I’m using <a class="reference external" href="http://tinkerer.me">Tinkerer</a> to create this blog.</p>
