            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Odoo... I mean OpenERP</h1>
<p>This is old news: OpenERP has changed its name and now becomes Odoo.  I don’t
care much about the change in the name.  It’s the processes I’m interested in.</p>
<p>The rename was synchronized with a move from <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a> to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">Github</a>.  This, I
much appreciate it.  I’m one of those that once the Git virus got me, I’m
almost unable to work comfortably with any other Version Control tool.</p>
<p>I this regard I have a couple of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Will they use the “standard” Github’s pull-requests model for contributions?
Probably they are longing for this kind of long-tail of contributors model
to kick off now at Github.  I haven’t found any “Why the move to Github” in
the FAQ of the move and other sources (but again my connection is slow and I
didn’t waste much time).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Will they require some kind of a “waive” of copyrights to accept
contributions?</p>
<p>The model of the Plone Foundation requires this.  But this foundation is
non-profit unlike Odoo.</p>
<p>Does this align with the company’s view of the Open Source model?  I don’t
know.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, my only strategy is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fork the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/odoo/odoo">Github repository</a></li>
<li>Send as many PRs as I’m able to fix/improve something and hope for the best.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="postdata">
<h2>Postdata</h2>
<p>My long-planned “<a class="reference external" href="http://manuelonsoftware.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/announcing-the-openerp-corner">OpenERP corner</a>” will simply be renamed accordingly.</p>
<p>This reminds me I have broken my promise to keep my old blog in-sync with this
new one.  Apologies.  But it’s sooo comfortable to work with this blog-model
that I barely looked back once.  So I’ll announce it: I will not keep my old
blog anymore.  I will commit myself to improve the look of this one and that’s
it.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>TDD is dead rally</h1>
<p>These days there’s a kind of a rally about “TDD being dead”.</p>
<p>Most TDD fan supporters are true that you must have a way to proof your code
works.  Many computer <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">scientists</a> have done several attempts into
the “proofs of correctness” for a program.  But tests are not always proofs,
some are <a class="footnote-reference" href="#some-are" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>I think the main argument is about when TDD is too much.  Several <a class="reference external" href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com">Destroy all
software</a> screencasts show a TDD flow that I simply find it’s too
much.  But they are, indeed, screencasts; and they are probably intended to
illustrate a point and not to be followed without deviations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I don’t like the “TDD is dead” mantra either.  It gives space to
a flame war I’m not willing to get into.  I use tests and that’s it.  Tests,
at different, levels may express several concerns I need to keep stable:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p class="first">A public API, for instance, should not change just like that.  At least not
after you have made the commitment to keep it stable.</p>
<p>You may even need to test for deprecation warnings being issued when you
need to change an API.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Collaborative in-progress debugging.  This tests allow to express standing
issues.  Some regression tests fall into this category.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you do tests?</p>
<div class="section" id="update-amplification-and-support-to-david-s-arguments">
<h2>Update: Amplification and support to <a class="reference external" href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">David’s arguments</a></h2>
<p>The previous words were written just after skimming over several tweets.  I
had read <a class="reference external" href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/test-induced-design-damage.html">David’s test-induced design damage</a> but I had missed the previous
post <a class="reference external" href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">TDD is dead.  Long live testing</a>.  So this update is my one cent to
the issue, but I will not discuss about “slow collaborators” but about my
design experience with our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/xotl.ql">Python Query Language</a>.</p>
<p>The test-first mantra assumes too much about how you are going to decompose
your problem.  Let’s start with a retrospective account of how this happened
in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/xotl.ql">xotl.ql</a>.</p>
<p>I can detect four distinct stages:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p class="first">The beginnings.  Slightly TDD, but the tests were not always written before
code.  Since <cite>xotl.ql</cite> is just a language we were not sure about what to
test.</p>
<p>The idea of having a <a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.org/en/latest/terms.html#term-query-object" title="(in xotl.ql v0.2)"><em class="xref std std-term">query object</em></a> that stands for the expression
was not totally consolidated.  The components of the query were not
defined.  This stage was heavily driven by our own writings, like <a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.org/en/latest/thoughts.html">this one</a>.</p>
<p>In this case the “literate” spirit dominated the design process, not the
testing.  Simply we didn’t have a full-stack: ie. the language and the
<a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.org/en/latest/terms.html#term-query-translator" title="(in xotl.ql v0.2)"><em class="xref std std-term">translators</em></a> so that a query could actually be
executed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Consolidation of the design.  In this stage several devices were invented
to cope with implementation difficulties, i.e. the <a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.org/en/latest/inners.html#inner-workings" title="(in xotl.ql v0.2)"><em class="xref std std-ref">lack of clear
boundaries</em></a> between several sub-expressions in a
single <a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.org/en/latest/terms.html#term-query" title="(in xotl.ql v0.2)"><em class="xref std std-term">query</em></a>.</p>
<p>This was the hardest stage.  Testing was employed to keep track of several
design decisions.  In this stage made appearance our “Particle Bubble” and
this was complex enough to deserve a handful of tests.  Although several
tests did influence the design, they hardly drove it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Then the core was done and we turned to <a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/xotl.ql.translation.py.html#module-xotl.ql.translation.py" title="(in xotl.ql v0.2)"><span class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">translation</span></span></a>.  This stage was mainly TDD cause we
actually were testing a very TDD friendly layer:  Given this state of the
world, the following query should return these objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Our current stage. Although in a long pause, we have decided to wipe out
our entire design and do reverse engineering of python byte-code to extract
build the <a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.org/en/latest/terms.html#term-query-object" title="(in xotl.ql v0.2)"><em class="xref std std-term">query object</em></a>.</p>
<p>What is foreseeable is that again a kind of literate driven design is going
to be king: The core structure of the language (the query AST) is what’s
being designed so, what’s the point of asking if the result of calling a
function with a given query expression is a particular AST if the AST is
what’s needs to be validated not the function itself?  At this point this
is non-sense.  At a later stage where the AST is stable enough those kind
of tests would actually make sense: they will protect the query language
against unintentional API-breaking changes.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Progress moving to github.io</h1>
<p>As you may see, I have made some progress.  Basically, I have partially ported
my past look and feel, so that if looks like the old blog.  I still a work in
progress and the “responsive” stuff is not entirely done.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think this is good to go and will start blogging here from now
on.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>This post intends to be one to welcome my previous readers from <a class="reference external" href="http://manuelonsoftware.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>.  I
still have much to do to make this blog actually <strong>my</strong> blog:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Polish a theme that resembles my current Wordpress look and feel.  I like
that central column, big fonts in big screens, unobtrusive reading and so
on.</li>
<li>Port my last posts to this new blog.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the moment, though, this post is enough to avoid the default “Not found”
message.  For the moment, also, I’m using <a class="reference external" href="http://tinkerer.me">Tinkerer</a> to create this blog.</p>
