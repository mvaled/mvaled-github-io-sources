Is not hard for me to state that the piece of music I enjoy the most is
Beethoven's 3rd movement of the 9th symphony.  I go back to it very often.

Of course there are other pieces I enjoy. This is small summary:

- Mozart's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 20.
- Dvorak's Concerto for Cello and Orchestra in B minor, 2nd movement.
- Rimsky-Korsakov's Scherezade.
- Schubert's Unfinished Symphony, 1st movement.

- Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody and Innuendo.
