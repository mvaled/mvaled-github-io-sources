<p class="first sidebar-title">Editorial note</p>
<p>I’m republishing this post from my <a class="reference external" href="http://manuelonsoftware.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/integration-v-automation/">old blog</a>.  It’s published as it were
when I first made it online with only minor changes.  I’m planning a follow
up on the subject and more post about my experiences with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.odoo.com/">Odoo</a> (OpenERP).
That’s I deem this repost needed.</p>
<p class="last">Hope you’ll enjoy the reading.</p>
</div>
<p>Being an OpenERP bee these days has lead me to think a bit about integration,
how does it happens inside OpenERP, its architecture, assumptions and other
stuff.  In a first iteration I used to think about integration in terms of
integrating two (or more) OpenERP addons, for instance, integrating Sales with
Accounting.  At a very programming-oriented level this reduces, in the current
state of OpenERP, to integrate their modules.  But later, I found out that
this approach is fundamentally flawed and causes many quirks.</p>
<p>This post starts with a tale about one of the many issues we have encounter
when deploying OpenERP in an small enterprise.  Then I will argue about what
integration means.  Lastly, I will turn to automation as a mean for
integration and not the only way to do it.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-integration-tale">
<h2>The Integration tale<a class="headerlink" href="#the-integration-tale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I want to start with a simple and very real <a class="footnote-reference" href="#accounting-last" id="id2">[1]</a> use case: Bob
is a salesperson processing a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management">CRM</a> lead.</p>
<p>The story beings when Bob opens the lead and clicks on the Edit button and the
first thing he tries to do is to fill the client’s contact info because it’s a
new client.  He clicks on the edit button besides the “Client” field which
opens a window.  He fills the data and clicks “save”, but suddenly it fails
saying that Bob (a salesperson) should have filled the “Account payable” and
“Account receivable” fields.  So Bob says:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Oh, boy!  What did I do wrong?.  Let’s try again…  Nope…  Uh.  What
should I do?</p>
<p>Hey!  Peter.  Do you know what’s happening here?  This won’t let me enter
this client’s contact data, it keeps telling me that these accounts are
wrong?  What the heck are these accounts anyway?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And Peter has no idea, so he calls Sally who’s a very pretty girl that
probably does not have a clue either about what’s happening but it’s so nice
to have a reason to approach her…  Surprisingly Sally seems to be only one
who actually paid attention to the information meeting that morning and she
says:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Ah!  This probably has to do with the Accounting module being installed.
They say they will do that today…  Let’s ask Stephanie.</div></blockquote>
<p>And Stephanie realizes what’s happening and fix it somehow.  An hour later Bob
can resume his work and finish processing his CRM lead.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>So, what is wrong with this story?</p>

<div class="section" id="depiction-of-wrongness">
<h3>Depiction of wrongness<a class="headerlink" href="#depiction-of-wrongness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In my opinion there are two things that are clearly wrong with this:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p class="first">Requiring data <em>when</em> it’s not required.  When you’re in a CRM use case
requiring accounting-related seems really overstepping.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Not being able to issue a request for completion.  Bob should have been
able to keep working and after the new client was saved a completion
request should have been sent to those being able to complete the data.</p>
<p>That completion request might just get ignored, but other use cases (like
submit an invoice to that client) would actually require the data and thus
the cycle would be closed after all.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some would think that this is just a “configuration problem” as we will
<a class="reference internal" href="2014/07/02/integration-v-automation.html#on-using-properties">discuss below</a>.  But finding that solution took me several dives into the
code and re-parsing of the documentation, so I’ll try to walk you through the
process.</p>

</div>
<p>By installing the “Accounting &amp; Finance” addon <a class="footnote-reference" href="#v-accountant" id="id4">[2]</a> you touch many
parts of your system besides installing new stuff.  In fact, the module forces
the installation of many other modules, including <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">product</span></span> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#no-gnucash" id="id5">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>It also modifies the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"res.partner"</span></span> model from the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">base</span></span> addon.  You may
think about the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"res.partner"</span></span> model as an attempt to merge the contact
information for both clients, suppliers and employees into a single
entity <a class="footnote-reference" href="#v-contact-info" id="id6">[4]</a>.  It has many fields that comprise name, job
position, contact information, etc…</p>
<p>When you install the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">account</span></span> addon, the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"res.partner"</span></span> gets appended a
whole bunch of other fields, including the said “account payable” and “account
receivable” fields, which are also marked as mandatory:</p>

</div>
<p>This are not actual fields of the model <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">"res.partner"</span></span>, but properties, which
are “special”.</p>
<div class="section" id="on-using-properties">
<h4>On using properties<a class="headerlink" href="#on-using-properties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Properties are of course related to the “solution” for the problem described
above.  But the solution is well hidden under the title of <a class="reference external" href="https://doc.openerp.com/book/1/1_3_Real_Case/1_3_Real_Case_db_setup/">Database setup</a>
in the OpenERP Book.  That’s the reason I’m using this case to open the
<cite>OpenERP corner</cite>.  If you deploy CRM before accounting <a class="footnote-reference" href="#accounting-last" id="id7">[1]</a>
you’d probably find no interest in reading a topic called “Database setup”…
you have set your database up already, haven’t you?</p>
<p>You should notice that both <cite>Account receivable</cite> and <cite>Account payable</cite> are, in
fact, properties (i.e defined via <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fields.property</span></span>).  This actually means
that those fields take their default values from a global configuration.</p>
<p>Those values were not properly set in our case cause there were no localized
account chart that applied to our enterprise.  We have to create all the
accounts by hand, and yes, we missed (didn’t know) that we have to create
those properties.</p>
<p>Our problem is solved by defining those properties in the configuration menu.</p>
<p>However this workaround is very unsatisfying:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It involves the administrator of the system because he’s the one that has
access to the “Configuration Parameters”.  AFAIK, the accountant
himself/herself cannot change the defaults, unless you bestow all the powers
on him/her.</li>
<li>It does not resolve the integration problem others might present in the
future.  Integration is harder that having some default values.  For
instance, Cuban accounting norms establish more than 10 accounts for
receivables with empty slots for more if needed.  They require to have
different accounts (receivable and/or payable) for bills to/from people
(B2C) separated from those bills to/from other enterprises (B2B), and also
different accounts for long-term and short-terms bills.  The last case
cannot be decided by just looking at the client or supplier, more
information about the <cite>economic fact</cite> is needed.</li>
<li>It does not actually resolve the current integration problem since the
accountant needs to make sure the “Account Receivable” is the correct one
for the client and he’s not notified when salesman Bob creates a new
partner.  So, what really happens is that the accountant needs to review
journal entries and before posting them, and change the account if needed.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="id8">
<h2>Integration v. Automation<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An ERP should simplify things by <em>integrating business areas</em>, shouldn’t it?
That’s the main driver behind the feature of automatically generating journal
entries.  Under this principle when an invoice is sent to a client a journal
entry should be made recording we should get paid for that, ie.  the client’s
account receivable gets increased <a class="footnote-reference" href="#account-normal-balance" id="id9">[5]</a>.  Likewise when
we get a supplier invoice, an entry should record that we must pay that bill,
ie.  the supplier’s account payable gets increased.</p>
<p>You see now how the “Account Receivable” and “Account Payable” fields for the
partner play their part in the <em>automation</em> of the accounting processes.  This
is deeply weaved into the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">account</span></span> module’s source code.  Meaning that
there’s the assumption that partners have those properties we’re talking
about.  And that’s true because you have injected them and, if you configured
everything as expected, they have their default values.</p>
<p>Notice the difference between the expectation of <em>integration</em> of business
areas and how the integration happens in this case via a very specific kind of
<em>automation</em>.</p>
<p>I’ll argue that the current state of this design is flawed.  When standards
change and/or are not applicable this kind of automation does more harm that
it helps.</p>
<p>This is the reason the module that controls the “Anglo-Saxon
accounting” <a class="footnote-reference" href="#basis" id="id10">[6]</a> is very difficult to understand and the result
artificial: they need an “interim” account to keep track the different stages.
In the standard (for OpenERP) accounting the event to produce journal items in
the debtor/creditor account is the creation of the invoice.  In the
anglo-saxon scheme the journal should be created at shipping time.</p>
<p>I argue that given another framework that clearly separates every actor and
function will improve how this pattern could be implemented.  I think that
this framework must have:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Signals and events.</li>
<li>Actors like the accountant, and probably an automated agent for the
accountant that could do the same the models do right now.  But being
responsive (ie. they respond to signals) they could be easily bypassed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course there are more things needed. I’m thinking about those two plus the
ones OpenERP already has.</p>
<p>I think that recognizing actors is the major improvement.  Actors are
abstractions about intelligence. If a person should be doing some kind of
intelligent decision (like accountants), then you should encode (in your
design) that decision as being taken by an actor.</p>
<p>Having artificial agents that could take over when the task is standard or
programmable is also an option in this case.  Anywhere in you design an actor
does something, and agent could be replacing the human.  The agents could be
as dumb as the couple of rules we have now: create a journal entry each time
an invoice goes to the valid state, and do it this way.  But agents could be
also provided of machine learning techniques and they could observe the how
the human accountant proceeds when something happened.  Of course this would
require the human to proceed in case-by-case fashion and that’s not always
true.</p>
<p>No matter if the machine learning is never done, I argue that designing with
actors and agents will lead to better a implementation, easier to understand,
maintain and evolve.</p>

<p>This is old news: OpenERP has changed its name and now becomes Odoo.  I don’t
care much about the change in the name.  It’s the processes I’m interested in.</p>
<p>The rename was synchronized with a move from <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a> to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.  This, I
much appreciate it.  I’m one of those that once the Git virus got me, I’m
almost unable to work comfortably with any other Version Control tool.</p>
<p>I this regard I have a couple of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Will they use the “standard” Github’s pull-requests model for contributions?
Probably they are longing for this kind of long-tail of contributors model
to kick off now at Github.  I haven’t found any “Why the move to Github” in
the FAQ of the move and other sources (but again my connection is slow and I
didn’t waste much time).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Will they require some kind of a “waive” of copyrights to accept
contributions?</p>
<p>The model of the Plone Foundation requires this.  But this foundation is
non-profit unlike Odoo.</p>
<p>Does this align with the company’s view of the Open Source model?  I don’t
know.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, my only strategy is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fork the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/odoo/odoo">Github repository</a></li>
<li>Send as many PRs as I’m able to fix/improve something and hope for the best.</li>

<p>My long-planned “<a class="reference external" href="http://manuelonsoftware.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/announcing-the-openerp-corner/">OpenERP corner</a>” will simply be renamed accordingly.</p>
<p>This reminds me I have broken my promise to keep my old blog in-sync with this
new one.  Apologies.  But it’s sooo comfortable to work with this blog-model
that I barely looked back once.  So I’ll announce it: I will not keep my old
blog anymore.  I will commit myself to improve the look of this one and that’s
it.</p>

<p>These days there’s a kind of a rally about “TDD being dead”.</p>
<p>Most TDD fan supporters are true that you must have a way to proof your code
works.  Many computer <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">scientists</a> have done several attempts into
the “proofs of correctness” for a program.  But tests are not always proofs,
some are <a class="footnote-reference" href="#some-are" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>I think the main argument is about when TDD is too much.  Several <a class="reference external" href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com">Destroy all
software</a> screencasts show a TDD flow that I simply find it’s too
much.  But they are, indeed, screencasts; and they are probably intended to
illustrate a point and not to be followed without deviations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I don’t like the “TDD is dead” mantra either.  It gives space to
a flame war I’m not willing to get into.  I use tests and that’s it.  Tests,
at different, levels may express several concerns I need to keep stable:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p class="first">A public API, for instance, should not change just like that.  At least not
after you have made the commitment to keep it stable.</p>
<p>You may even need to test for deprecation warnings being issued when you
need to change an API.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Collaborative in-progress debugging.  This tests allow to express standing
issues.  Some regression tests fall into this category.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you do tests?</p>

<p>The previous words were written just after skimming over several tweets.  I
had read <a class="reference external" href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/test-induced-design-damage.html">David’s test-induced design damage</a> but I had missed the previous
post <a class="reference external" href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">TDD is dead.  Long live testing</a>.  So this update is my one cent to
the issue, but I will not discuss about “slow collaborators” but about my
design experience with our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/xotl.ql">Python Query Language</a>.</p>
<p>The test-first mantra assumes too much about how you are going to decompose
your problem.  Let’s start with a retrospective account of how this happened
in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/xotl.ql">xotl.ql</a>.</p>
<p>I can detect four distinct stages:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p class="first">The beginnings.  Slightly TDD, but the tests were not always written before
code.  Since <cite>xotl.ql</cite> is just a language we were not sure about what to
test.</p>
<p>The idea of having a <a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/terms.html#term-query-object" title="(in xotl.ql v0.3.1)"><span class="xref std std-term">query object</span></a> that stands for the expression
was not totally consolidated.  The components of the query were not
defined.  This stage was heavily driven by our own writings, like <a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.org/en/latest/thoughts.html">this one</a>.</p>
<p>In this case the “literate” spirit dominated the design process, not the
testing.  Simply we didn’t have a full-stack: ie. the language and the
<a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/terms.html#term-query-translator" title="(in xotl.ql v0.3.1)"><span class="xref std std-term">translators</span></a> so that a query could actually be
executed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Consolidation of the design.  In this stage several devices were invented
to cope with implementation difficulties, i.e. the <a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_revenge/index.html#inner-workings" title="(in xotl.ql v0.3.1)"><span class="xref std std-ref">lack of clear
boundaries</span></a> between several sub-expressions in a
single <a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/terms.html#term-query" title="(in xotl.ql v0.3.1)"><span class="xref std std-term">query</span></a>.</p>
<p>This was the hardest stage.  Testing was employed to keep track of several
design decisions.  In this stage made appearance our “Particle Bubble” and
this was complex enough to deserve a handful of tests.  Although several
tests did influence the design, they hardly drove it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Then the core was done and we turned to <a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/translation/py.html#module-xotl.ql.translation.py" title="(in xotl.ql v0.3.1)"><span class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">translation</span></span></a>.  This stage was mainly TDD cause we
actually were testing a very TDD friendly layer:  Given this state of the
world, the following query should return these objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Our current stage. Although in a long pause, we have decided to wipe out
our entire design and do reverse engineering of python byte-code to extract
build the <a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/terms.html#term-query-object" title="(in xotl.ql v0.3.1)"><span class="xref std std-term">query object</span></a>.</p>
<p>What is foreseeable is that again a kind of literate driven design is going
to be king: The core structure of the language (the query AST) is what’s
being designed so, what’s the point of asking if the result of calling a
function with a given query expression is a particular AST if the AST is
what’s needs to be validated not the function itself?  At this point this
is non-sense.  At a later stage where the AST is stable enough those kind
of tests would actually make sense: they will protect the query language
against unintentional API-breaking changes.</p>

<p>As you may see, I have made some progress.  Basically, I have partially ported
my past look and feel, so that if looks like the old blog.  I still a work in
progress and the “responsive” stuff is not entirely done.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I think this is good to go and will start blogging here from now
on.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>This post intends to be one to welcome my previous readers from <a class="reference external" href="http://manuelonsoftware.wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>.  I
still have much to do to make this blog actually <strong>my</strong> blog:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Polish a theme that resembles my current Wordpress look and feel.  I like
that central column, big fonts in big screens, unobtrusive reading and so
on.</li>
<li>Port my last posts to this new blog.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the moment, though, this post is enough to avoid the default “Not found”
message.  For the moment, also, I’m using <a class="reference external" href="http://tinkerer.me/">Tinkerer</a> to create this blog.</p>
