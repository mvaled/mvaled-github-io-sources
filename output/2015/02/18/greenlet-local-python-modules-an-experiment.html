        <h2>Hot-swapping Python modules. An&nbsp;experiment.</h2>
        <p class="meta">2015-02-18 &bull; Manuel Vázquez Acosta</p>
    </header>
    <p>A new project I&#8217;m involved with will <em>probably</em> require dozens of servers
running several thousands <a class="reference external" href="https://greenlet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">greenlets</a> each.  Top-level greenlets represent jobs
and their children will be individual tasks those greenlets are&nbsp;coordinating/supervising.</p>
<p>This model, however prototypical, resembles that of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.erlang.org/"><span class="caps">OTP</span></a> in Erlang.  A
greenlet may be either a supervisor or a&nbsp;worker.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s something missing in our platform that Erlang do have and that
might yield huge benefits.  You can change your Erlang code while the program
is&nbsp;running.</p>
<div class="section" id="modulets-the-idea">
<h2>Modulets.  The&nbsp;idea</h2>
<p>I asked myself if I could devise an <em>import mechanism</em> that would allow to
update a Python module in a way that already-running greenlets stay unaffected
but newly created ones use the new&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>To exemplify, let&#8217;s say a typical tasks&nbsp;is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def receive_confirmation(message, who):
   from jobs.util.email import send_email
   from jobs.util.email import wait_reply
   # Assume both send_email and wait_reply switch away from the current
   # greenlet and only switch back after they are done.
   message = send_email(message, who)
   res = wait_reply(message)
   return res  # this will be sent to the parent greenlet
</pre>
<p>The servers start and hundreds of this task are launched in different jobs.
Many of them are idle waiting for their replies.  Users are happily getting
their confirmation emails and replying to them (or ignoring&nbsp;them).</p>
<p>However, we start receiving lot of bounces in the postmaster inbox.  Some
users have entered a wrong email address.  A change is in&nbsp;order.</p>
<p>In response, we change our implementation of <tt class="docutils literal">send_email</tt> so that it does
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_envelope_return_path"><span class="caps">VERP</span></a> to know which recipients&#8217; address are bouncing, and also create a new
<cite>job</cite> that involves receiving confirmation email when a new user&nbsp;registers.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d love to simply update our <tt class="docutils literal">jobs.util</tt> package and be done with it like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ source server-virtual-env/bin/activate
$ pip install -U jobs.util -i https://my.private.server/
</pre>
<p>New jobs will pick up the new version and the older jobs will keep working as
if nothing would have&nbsp;changed.</p>
<p>That would be really nice.  Such a hot-swap of Python modules per job is what
I&#8217;m calling a&nbsp;&#8220;modulet&#8221;.</p>
<p>Currently I have a &#8220;working&#8221; <strong>yet very experimental and undertested</strong>
implementation of such a mechanism in our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/xoutil/tree/experimental-modulets/xoutil/modules">experimental modulets branch</a> in&nbsp;xoutil.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="modulets-in-xoutil">
<h2>Modulets in&nbsp;xoutil</h2>
<p>The current implementation is a very early proof of concept and not something
you&#8217;d like to put outside your&nbsp;playground.</p>
<p>The file <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/xoutil/blob/experimental-modulets/xoutil/modules/test_modulet.py"><tt class="docutils literal">test_modulet.py</tt></a> is a simple script you may run to see it working.
It simply creates a temporary module <tt class="docutils literal">magic_module</tt> that has the
<tt class="docutils literal">get_magic</tt> function.  This function returns a single&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>The test launches three greenlets that simply call the <tt class="docutils literal">get_magic</tt> function
and asserts it returns the &#8220;right&#8221; magic value.  Between launches the module
gets updated to return a different magic value, which is passed as an argument
to the newly created&nbsp;greenlet.</p>
<p>A single run will print something&nbsp;like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ python test_modulet.py
Beginning with 3 in /tmp/tmp1d4rK5
Isolating 'magic_module' as '&lt;greenlet.greenlet object at 0x7f21f4e8daf0&gt;.magic_module'
Isolating 'magic_module' as '&lt;greenlet.greenlet object at 0x7f21f4e8da50&gt;.magic_module'
Isolating 'magic_module' as '&lt;greenlet.greenlet object at 0x7f21f4daa7d0&gt;.magic_module'
Passed. I have the right magic number 1002
Passed. I have the right magic number 1001
Passed. I have the right magic number 1000
</pre>
<p>If you comment the bootstrapping of modulets, then you&#8217;ll get something&nbsp;like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ python test_modulet.py
Beginning with 3 in /tmp/tmpeI1oYA

<h2>Future&nbsp;work</h2>
<p>Since we are at the very early stages of this project is not easy to predict
if we&#8217;ll keep modulets in our platform.  Probably a <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/">celery</a> based solution be&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>If we were to keep it, there are several things to&nbsp;improve:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The current mechanism pollutes the <tt class="docutils literal">sys.modules</tt> with a copy of a module
per top-level&nbsp;greenlet.</p>
<p>In the current state, this is an ever-growing pile of modules that never
erases those that are no longer&nbsp;used.</p>
<p>This needs to be changed in several&nbsp;ways:</p>
<p>The namespace we use to masquerade the modules need not be (and should not
be) the repr of the greenlet&nbsp;object.</p>
<p>For the purposes of isolating different versions of the same code we can
either use the timestamp of the files, the version of the distribution,&nbsp;etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Running a <a class="reference external" href="http://diesel.io/">diesel</a> server will quickly eat all your <span class="caps">RAM</span> unless this is&nbsp;changed.</p>
<p>When a <a class="reference external" href="https://greenlet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">greenlet</a> dies the only one informed is its parent.  But we certainly
don&#8217;t want jobs to mess with <tt class="docutils literal">sys.modules</tt> to clean our own&nbsp;mess.</p>
<p>This poses a challenge of its own and may be delegated outside <cite>xoutil</cite>
itself.</p>
<p>That being said, it&#8217;s likely that the calculation of the current namespace
and how to dispose of unused modules will be extensions points of
<cite>modulets</cite>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Currently we have a black-list of modules that will never be&nbsp;isolated.</p>
<p>Changes in those modules will required a restart to be noticed.  Those
modules are platform-level.  They include <cite>xoutil</cite> itself, <cite>greenlet</cite> and
the entire standard library (which is not expected to change unless you
change&nbsp;Python).</p>
<p>We can also allow white-listing.  Both ways are on the&nbsp;table.</p>
<p>The white-list imposes more explicit architecture of your platform since it
requires throughout revision of which modules you&#8217;re willing to update on
the&nbsp;run.</p>
<p>Access to both lists will be a public <span class="caps">API</span> of the Modulet Manager.  I can
envision a remote-control console you&#8217;ll use to include a new module in the
white-list.  But that will be an application of the modulet <span class="caps">API</span> and included
in the&nbsp;box.</p>
