<p class="first sidebar-title">Editorial&nbsp;note</p>
<p>I&#8217;m republishing this post from my old blog (which is no longer online).
It&#8217;s published as it were when I first made it online with only minor
changes.  But I think I stand by this&nbsp;still.</p>
<p class="last">Hope you&#8217;ll enjoy the&nbsp;reading.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s probably harsh, but I think it is absolutely right.  Doing crappy
software today to be more productive today will make you less productive
tomorrow.  It&#8217;s this simple.  And that&#8217;s cumulative too; meaning that if you
neglect your future productivity, it will be slowly diminishing until a point
of negative competitive disadvantage where you&#8217;ll find yourself struggling to
keep up instead of&nbsp;innovating.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s so damn exhausting to explain&nbsp;why&#8230;</p>
<p>Software complexity does not come from the tools, but from the mental
framework required (and imposed at times) to understand it.  So don&#8217;t ever
think measuring Cyclomatic Complexity (<span class="caps">CC</span>) and other similar metrics will
yield something close to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">true measure</a> of the
<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/whos-your-coding-buddy/">quality of your code</a>.</p>

def _check(l):
    if len(l) &lt;= 1:
       return l
    l1, l2 = [], []
    m = l[0]
    for x in l[1:]:
       if x &lt;=m :
          l1.append(x)

<p>This code has a nice <span class="caps">CC</span> of 4 which is very nice; yet it will take you at least
a minute to figure out what it does.  If only I had chosen to name the
function <cite>quicksort</cite>&#8230;</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; _check([84, 95, 89, 4, 77, 24, 95, 86, 70, 16])
[4, 16, 24, 70, 77, 84, 86, 89, 95, 95]

<p>A quiz in less than 5 seconds: What does it mean in OpenERP&#8217;s <span class="caps">ORM</span> the
following lines of&nbsp;code?</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
group.write({'implied_ids': [(3, implied_group.id)]})
</pre>
<p>This line of code has a <span class="caps">CC</span> of 1: as good as it gets, isn&#8217;t it?  But it&#8217;s so
darn difficult to read that unless you have your brain wired up to see &#8220;forget
the link between this group and the implied_group&#8221;&#8230;  To be fair there is
someone out there in the OpenERP universe that cared a bit about&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# file addons/base/ir/ir_fields.py

CREATE = lambda values: (0, False, values)
UPDATE = lambda id, values: (1, id, values)
DELETE = lambda id: (2, id, False)
FORGET = lambda id: (3, id, False)
LINK_TO = lambda id: (4, id, False)
DELETE_ALL = lambda: (5, False, False)
REPLACE_WITH = lambda ids: (6, False, ids)
</pre>
<p>But no one else is using&nbsp;it!</p>
<p>And, yes, it&#8217;s exhausting going over&nbsp;this.</p>
