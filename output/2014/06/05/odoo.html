    </header>
    <p>This is old news: OpenERP has changed its name and now becomes Odoo.  I don't
care much about the change in the name.  It's the processes I'm interested in.</p>
<p>The rename was synchronized with a move from <a class="reference external" href="https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a> to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.  This, I
much appreciate it.  I'm one of those that once the Git virus got me, I'm
almost unable to work comfortably with any other Version Control tool.</p>
<p>I this regard I have a couple of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Will they use the &quot;standard&quot; Github's pull-requests model for contributions?
Probably they are longing for this kind of long-tail of contributors model
to kick off now at Github.  I haven't found any &quot;Why the move to Github&quot; in
the FAQ of the move and other sources (but again my connection is slow and I
didn't waste much time).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Will they require some kind of a &quot;waive&quot; of copyrights to accept
contributions?</p>
<p>The model of the Plone Foundation requires this.  But this foundation is
non-profit unlike Odoo.</p>
<p>Does this align with the company's view of the Open Source model?  I don't
know.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, my only strategy is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fork the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/odoo/odoo">Github repository</a></li>
<li>Send as many PRs as I'm able to fix/improve something and hope for the best.</li>
</ul>
<p>Postdata</p>
<p>My long-planned &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://manuelonsoftware.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/announcing-the-openerp-corner/">OpenERP corner</a>&quot; will simply be renamed accordingly.</p>
<p>This reminds me I have broken my promise to keep my old blog in-sync with this
new one.  Apologies.  But it's sooo comfortable to work with this blog-model
that I barely looked back once.  So I'll announce it: I will not keep my old
blog anymore.  I will commit myself to improve the look of this one and that's
it.</p>
