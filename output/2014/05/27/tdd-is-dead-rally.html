        <h2>TDD is dead rally</h2>
        <p class="meta">2014-05-27 &bull; Manuel Vázquez Acosta</p>
    </header>
    <p>These days there's a kind of a rally about &quot;TDD being dead&quot;.</p>
<p>Most TDD fan supporters are true that you must have a way to proof your code
works.  Many computer <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">scientists</a> have done several attempts into
the &quot;proofs of correctness&quot; for a program.  But tests are not always proofs,
some are <a class="footnote-reference" href="#some-are" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>I think the main argument is about when TDD is too much.  Several <a class="reference external" href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com">Destroy all
software</a> screencasts show a TDD flow that I simply find it's too
much.  But they are, indeed, screencasts; and they are probably intended to
illustrate a point and not to be followed without deviations.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I don't like the &quot;TDD is dead&quot; mantra either.  It gives space to
a flame war I'm not willing to get into.  I use tests and that's it.  Tests
at different levels may express several concerns I need to keep stable:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p class="first">A public API, for instance, should not change just like that.  At least not
after you have made the commitment to keep it stable.</p>
<p>You may even need to test for deprecation warnings being issued when you
need to change an API.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Collaborative in-progress debugging.  This tests allow to express standing
issues.  Some regression tests fall into this category.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How do you do tests?</p>

<h2>Update: Amplification and support to <a class="reference external" href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">David's arguments</a></h2>
<p>The previous words were written just after skimming over several tweets.  I
had read <a class="reference external" href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/test-induced-design-damage.html">David's test-induced design damage</a> but I had missed the previous
post <a class="reference external" href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">TDD is dead.  Long live testing</a>.  So this update is my one cent to
the issue.  I will not discuss about &quot;slow collaborators&quot; but about my design
experience with our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/xotl.ql">Python Query Language</a>.</p>
<p>The test-first mantra assumes too much about how you are going to decompose
your problem.  Let's start with a retrospective account of how this happened
in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/merchise-autrement/xotl.ql">xotl.ql</a>.</p>
<p>I can detect four distinct stages:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p class="first">The beginnings.</p>
<p>We wrote some tests, but never written before code.  Since <tt class="docutils literal">xotl.ql</tt> is
just a language we were not sure about what to test.</p>
<p>The idea of having a <em>query object</em> that stands for the expression
was not totally consolidated.  The components of the query were not
defined.  This stage was heavily driven by our own writings, like <a class="reference external" href="http://xotl-ql.readthedocs.org/en/latest/thoughts.html">this one</a>.</p>
<p>In this case the &quot;literate&quot; spirit dominated the design process, not the
testing.  Simply we didn't have a full-stack: ie. the language and the
<em>translators (query translator)</em> so that a query could actually be
executed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Consolidation of the design.  In this stage several devices were invented
to cope with implementation difficulties, i.e. the lack of clear
boundaries between several sub-expressions in a
single <em>query</em>.</p>
<p>This was the hardest stage.  Testing was employed to keep track of several
design decisions.  In this stage made appearance our &quot;Particle Bubble&quot; and
this was complex enough to deserve a handful of tests.  Although several
tests did influence the design, they hardly drove it.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Then the core was done and we turned to <cite>translation</cite>.  This stage was
mainly TDD cause we actually were testing a very TDD friendly layer: Given
this state of the world, the following query should return these objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Our current stage. Although in a long pause, we have decided to wipe out
our entire design and do reverse engineering of python byte-code to extract
build the query object.</p>
<p>What is foreseeable is that again a kind of literate driven design is going
to be king: The core structure of the language (the query AST) is what's
being designed so, what's the point of asking if the result of calling a
function with a given query expression is a particular AST if the AST is
what's needs to be validated not the function itself?  At this point this
is non-sense.  At a later stage where the AST is stable enough those kind
of tests would actually make sense: they will protect the query language
against unintentional API-breaking changes.</p>
