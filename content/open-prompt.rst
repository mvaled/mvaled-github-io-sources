 Open Prompt

:status: draft

I asked a college to share the prompts to get some script.  They won't share
it.  I was a surprise of sorts, but I moved on and I started thinking about
sharing prompts the same way we share code.

So I search for "Open Prompt" and there is already an `Open Prompt`_ site to
share some.  It seems quite disorganized, though.
