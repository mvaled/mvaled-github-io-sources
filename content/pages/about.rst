Hi, my name is Manuel VÃ¡zquez Acosta.

I was 13 years old, when I first saw a computer, a MSX Basic computer that
made me want to pursue a career.  I learned back then the basics of
programming in Basic, and a few months later I was already doing a bit of
Pascal.  In a short time, I was exposed to the interpreter/compiler division,
but I didn't think much about it at the time.

It wasn't until I actually went into the University where I became really
aware of the vast universe that Computation, Programming, and Software
Engineer were.  Computer Sciences became a true part of way of understanding
how software is built.  Software Engineering taught about the constraints of
the real world when it comes to make commercial software.

This blog is a very loose collection of thoughts, mostly about computing,
programming languages, and software engineer.

I hope you enjoy it.
