Hi, my name is Manuel VÃ¡zquez

I was 13 years old, when I first saw a computer, a MSX Basic computer that
made me want to pursue a career related to computers.

I learned back then the basics of programming in Basic, and a few months later
I was already doing a bit of Pascal.  In a short time, I was exposed to the
interpreter/compiler division, but I didn't think much about it at the time.

It wasn't until I actually went into the University where I became really
aware of how vast was the universe that Computation and Programming.  Computer
Sciences became a true part of my way of understanding how software is built.
Building actual usable software taught me about the constraints of the real
world when it comes to make commercial software, and appreciate the
engineering part of it.

This blog is a very loose collection of thoughts, mostly about computing,
programming languages, and software engineer.

I hope you enjoy it.
