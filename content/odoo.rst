Odoo... I mean OpenERP
======================

This is old news: OpenERP has changed its name and now becomes Odoo.  I don't
care much about the change in the name.  It's the processes I'm interested in.

The rename was synchronized with a move from Launchpad_ to Github_.  This, I
much appreciate it.  I'm one of those that once the Git virus got me, I'm
almost unable to work comfortably with any other Version Control tool.

I this regard I have a couple of questions:

- Will they use the "standard" Github's pull-requests model for contributions?
  Probably they are longing for this kind of long-tail of contributors model
  to kick off now at Github.  I haven't found any "Why the move to Github" in
  the FAQ of the move and other sources (but again my connection is slow and I
  didn't waste much time).

- Will they require some kind of a "waive" of copyrights to accept
  contributions?

  The model of the Plone Foundation requires this.  But this foundation is
  non-profit unlike Odoo.

  Does this align with the company's view of the Open Source model?  I don't
  know.

So, my only strategy is:

- Fork the `Github repository`_

- Send as many PRs as I'm able to fix/improve something and hope for the best.

My long-planned "`OpenERP corner`_" will simply be renamed accordingly.

This reminds me I have broken my promise to keep my old blog in-sync with this
new one.  Apologies.  But it's sooo comfortable to work with this blog-model
that I barely looked back once.  So I'll announce it: I will not keep my old
blog anymore.  I will commit myself to improve the look of this one and that's
it.
