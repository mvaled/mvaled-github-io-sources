As you may see, I have made some progress.  Basically, I have partially ported
my past look and feel, so that if looks like the old blog.  I still a work in
progress and the "responsive" stuff is not entirely done.

Nevertheless, I think this is good to go and will start blogging here from now
on.

Enjoy!
